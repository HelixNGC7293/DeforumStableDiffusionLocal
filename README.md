Made this quick local Windows version mostly based on the Colab code by deforum, which supports very cool turbo mode animation output for Stable Diffusion!

As an artist and Unity game designer, I may not very familiar with Python code, so let me know whether there is any improvement for this project!

It's tested working on Windows 10 with RTX 2080 SUPER and RTX 3090 GPU (it runs somehow much faster on my local 3090 then Colab..), **I haven't tested it on Mac though.**

## Installation

You can use an [anaconda](https://conda.io/) environment to host this local project:

```
conda create --name dsd python=3.10.6 -y
conda activate dsd
```

And then cd to the cloned folder, run the setup code, and wait for ‚âà 5min until it's finished

```
python setup.py
```

## Manually download 3 Model Files
**You need to put these 3 model files on the `./models` folder:**

**`v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt`, can be downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main).**

**`dpt_large-midas-2f21e586.pt`, [the download link is here](https://github.com/intel-isl/DPT/releases/download/1_0/dpt_large-midas-2f21e586.pt)**

**`AdaBins_nyu.pt`, [the download link is here](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/Qmd2mMnDLWePKmgfS8m6ntAg4nhV5VkUyAydYBp8cWWeB7/AdaBins_nyu.pt)**


## How to use it?

After installation, you can try out this command to see if the code is working.
The running command should looks like this:
```
python run.py --enable_animation_mode --settings "./runSettings_Template.txt" --model "v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt"
```

You can also load customized dreambooth models by putting your model file on the `./models` folder, and replace the `--model` parameter with the new model name.

Here are some extra examples for your reference. You can easily create your own txt file based on these templates!

- 1. For generate still images:
```
python run.py --settings "./examples/runSettings_StillImages.txt"
```
- 2. For animation feature, you need to add `--enable_animation_mode` to enable animation settings in text file:
```
python run.py --enable_animation_mode --settings "./examples/runSettings_Animation.txt"
```
- 3. For mask feature:
```
python run.py --settings "./examples/runSettings_Mask.txt"
```
- 4. For new feature of Deforum V0.7:
```
python run.py --enable_animation_mode --settings "./examples/runSettings_AnimationExtra.txt"
```

**The output results will be available at `./output` folder.**

All the needed variables & prompts for Deforum Stable Diffusion are set in the txt file (You can refer to the [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deforum/stable-diffusion/blob/main/Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb) page for definition of all the variables), you can have many of settings files for different tasks. There is a template file called `runSettings_Template.txt`. You can create your own txt settings file as well.

# **For usage of all the parameters, [you can follow this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RrQv7FntzOuLg4ohjRZPVL7iptIyBhwwbcEYEW2OfcI)**

That's it!
